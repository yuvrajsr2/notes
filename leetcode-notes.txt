notes for leetcode and data structures



1. two sum(easy) : Concept: Hash map + complement lookup
Logic:
For each number, calculate target - num
If that value already exists in the dictionary → return both indices
Else, store current number and index
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
Pattern: Hash map lookup (complement trick)


2. The Two Sneaky Numbers of Digitville(easy) : Concept: Hash map / set for duplicate detection
Logic:
Track numbers seen so far (with a set or array)
Loop through the list:
If number already seen → it’s a duplicate → store it
Else → add number to seen
Return the two duplicates
Time Complexity:
Using list for seen → O(n²)
Using set or array → O(n)
Space Complexit: O(n)
Pattern: Counting / duplicate detection using a hash map or frequency array

notes for leetcode and data structures



1. two sum : Concept: Hash map + complement lookup
Logic:
For each number, calculate target - num
If that value already exists in the dictionary â†’ return both indices
Else, store current number and index
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
Pattern: Hash map lookup (complement trick)
